Here, we have identified the specific 32 mer region of Epap-1 that can interact with V3 loop. This was achieved by docking between Epap-1 molecular model and gp120 and studying the interaction of peptides with gp120 in vitro. Out of four peptides analyzed, two peptides (P-2 and P-3) showed significant interaction with V3 domain (N=8; N=7) of gp120. In the studies conducted using soluble gp120 and virus, peptide P-2 has shown conserved interaction at V3 loop regions recognized by 257D and F425 antibodies and higher anti-viral activity. Also, P-2 inhibited cell fusion mediated dye transfer between gp120 expressing HL2/3 and CD4 expressing. Sup T1 cells suggesting its inhibition of viral entry, which is further confirmed by its action on HIV infection mediated by Tat activated beta gal expression in TZM-bl cells. Further optimization of P-2 peptide showed that the anti-viral activity and gp120 interaction residues lie in the N-terminal region of the peptide. These results together suggest that P-2 inhibits viral entry through specific interaction at V3 loop region.\nPre-PhD RESEARCH PROJECTS \nAs part of my MSc course, I have done a project entitled Isolation of DNA binding, Integration host factor from Halomonas eurihalina under Prof. T. Suryanarayana, School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad.\nI executed a project on Differential action of Luteinising hormone on Leydig cells of Testis and on the gene and protein expression profile in the Rat Epidydimis of different age groups under Prof. A. Jagannadha Rao, Dept of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, during June-Oct 2005. We checked the differences in the protein expression by 2D Electrophoresis and the gene profile by Differential DisplayRT-PCR.\nRESEARCH EXPERIENCE \nNeuroscience \nI worked on the role of Topoisomerase II in ageing and DNA repair pathway of primary neurons. In this I isolated the granule neurons from 7 day old rat pups and estimated the RNA levels of Topoisomerase II and other repair proteins during different ageing periods. Another work involved in depicting the role of Topo II in the DNA repair pathway when the neurons were inflicted to damage by H2O2. Here the Topo II was found to associate with two major DNA repair enzymes Ku70 and PARP-1. The above results suspect a possible role of Topo II in ageing related disorders of brain like Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. Additionally we have characterized the homogeneous culture of substantia nigral neurons in terms of its invitro maturation. In all the above studies we have found a significant association of Topo II in various processes like DNA repair, Ageing etc. An important observation is the non replicative functions of TopoII are playing an important role in various disease processes. \nDrug synthesis, formulation and delivery\nI have synthesized the anti-cancer, anti-HIV drugs namely ferrocene derivatives which were the inhibitors of Topoisomerase and pyridine derivatives which were supposed to inhibit a HIV specific kinase (Unpublished). My major inputs in Cancer Chemotherapy are on improving the drug delivery by blending nanotechnology. Here we checked the efficacy of doxorubicin when encapsulated with protein nanoparticles during intravenous and oral administration. Nanoformulations of Doxorubicin exhibited better bioavailability, pharmacokinetic profile when compared to the existing formulations in the market with lesser off-target affects. The administration of these nanoformulations is much safer since very less amount of drug is used for the encapsulation in nanoparticles when compared to the remaining modalities. More importantly targeted delivery was achieved due to the specificity of the protein molecules employed whose receptors were over expressed on the cancer cells. The same strategy is now being continued for the development of novel formulations of first and second line regimens of antiretrovirals.\nHIV Research\nI worked on the mechanism of TopoII in the transactivation of viral DNA during HIV infection. As the role of Topo II was addressed in the activation of transcription of few genes, its activity in chromatin reorganization in the context of HIV infection was studied. This had a focus on the novel pathways that were being operated during epigenetic modifications which will indirectly aid in the understanding of pathogenesis of various diseases. I worked on the development of various nanoformulations of microbicides with curcumin and other antiretroviral drugs using different proteins. We have studied host Immune cell and Cytokine patterns in a couple of cohorts, Long term nonprogressors (LTNPs) who are asymptomatic despite of having HIV infection and Serodiscordant couples in which one partner is seronegative. \nPrecision Oncology\nTargeted therapy has gained credibility in reinforcing and/or replacing conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy with precision oncology to improve efficacy, minimize side effects of drugs and avoid drug resistance. To make the treatment functionally relevant and biologically significant towards the individuals tumor nature, we are working on a panel of Next Generation Functional assays with predictive and prognostic markers focusing on clinical outcome and response which includes Chemosensitivity, NGS, RT PCR, FISH, Immune panel and other parameters which can tumor microenvironment\nStem cell Therapy\nAs a part of collaborative work with a company, I have isolated, cultured and characterized Mesenchymal Stem cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood for the treatment of Vascular and bone disorders like Stroke, Ischemia and Arthritis.\nCOMPLETED PROJECTS as a Ph.D and post-doc \n1.

Every patient is also unique due to the complex interplay of Genome, Epigenome, Proteome, Microbiome, Lifestyle, Physiological Stress, Diet etc. which can influence Oncogenesis, Tumor progression, Drug tolerance, Remission, and Relapse. The combination of all the above complex processes, and parameters makes the pathophysiology of Cancer the most difficult for clinical decision making.\nTreatment has to be functionally relevant and biologically significant towards the individuals tumor nature. Targeted therapy has gained credibility in reinforcing and/or replacing conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy with precision oncology to improve efficacy, minimize side effects of drugs and avoid drug resistance. \nWe work on a Panomic, state of art clinical decision support system with predictive and prognostic Next Generation Functional assays as companion diagnostics for implementing precise, selective, and targeted therapies focusing on clinical outcome and response.\nOur test panels include CTC CHEMRES-Test, Genomic Panel, Gene expression panel, Liquid biopsy, Biomarker panels like Immune, Endocrine, Neural, Biochemical etc.\n\n\n",
