They can give the feedback and submit the form. The HOD of the departments have separate log in, also, The Principal has a separate log in.

Here, the mouse events are handled by the human face i.e. with the help of eyes and nose. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Six-Segmented Rectangular (SSR) filter Algorithms are used for the detection and tracking of the face, nose is used for moving the cursor and eyes are used for left and right click.\nProject Title : Web-Page Recommendation Using an Enhanced Incremental Sequence Mining Algorithm Along With Ontology.\nTechnology : Java 1.8 Tool : Protg 4.3\nDuration : 10 Months\nDescription : This is a web page recommendation system which is developed using a combination of domain knowledge of a web site called as ontology and a web usage mining technique. Domain Knowledge is gained by semi automatically constructing an ontology using a tool called protg. When the ontology is developed it is combined with the web usage mining technique which is going to generate frequent patterns of the user. Combination of these two techniques enhances the performance of web page recommendation system so that it recommends appropriate web pages in less execution time.\nAchievement and Certifications\n  Software Testing Certification Course from Advanto Software, Pune.\n  Certification Course In Core Java from NICS, Pune.\n Certification Course in Networking Basics CCNA,Mumbai.\n  Attended Two Days National Level Seminar On Big Data & Hadoop.\n  Participated in Aptitude Cracker in college event Impact at Rajarshi Shahu College of Engineering.\n  Worked as Additional Officer Incharge in RAC(Regional Assessment Center) Summer 2019\nMSBTE Exam.\n  Published Research papers in-\n i) International Journal of Computer Science Trends and Technology (IJCST)\n ii)International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies(IJCSIT).\n iii)CPGCON-2016-A Post Graduation Conference conducted by Savitribai Phule Pune\nUniversity.\nPersonal Details\nDate of Birth: 20/08/1992\nStrengths: I am positive in attitude, quick to grasp information, have dedication in my work.\nHobbies: Travelling, Listening Music, Making New Friends.
