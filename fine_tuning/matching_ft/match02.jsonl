The quality of patterns in data mining depends on the quality of input data. The incomplete data leads to poor quality patterns as result which becomes useless. In this project, missing data imputation method called KCBGMI is proposed to make the database as complete which is the precious quality of good and quality dataset. First the supplied dataset is decomposed into the complete and incomplete instances. Complete datasets are clustered using KFCM (Kernel Fuzzy c Means). And then missing values in each of incomplete datasets are computed using GRA and entropy based multiple imputations. The proposed method is tested with few existing methods in real time UCI-Wine dataset with various missing ratios. \\nAchievements & Extra Curricular\\n Got Centum in Mathematics in Tenth Board Examination\\n First mark in Numerical Methods in Master of Computer Application.\\n Completed Type writing in Higher\\nPersonal Profile\\nName\\n : ROHINI.
