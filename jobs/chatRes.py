To calculate the matched percentage between the job description (JD) and the resume, we will evaluate each criteria and assign a value between 0 and 100 based on the alignment. Here is the calculation:

1. Skills: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the matching skills mentioned in the resume with the required skills in the JD.

2. Roles and Responsibilities: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the alignment of the roles and responsibilities mentioned in the resume with those mentioned in the JD.

4. Educational Qualifications: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the educational qualifications mentioned in the resume and how they match with the required qualifications in the JD.

5. Industry-Specific Experience: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the industry-specific experience mentioned in the resume and how it aligns with the industry mentioned in the JD.

6. Domain-Specific Experience: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the domain-specific experience mentioned in the resume and how it matches with the domain mentioned in the JD.

7. Certifications: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the certifications mentioned in the resume and how they align with the required certifications in the JD.

8. Technical Tools and Languages: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the technical tools and languages mentioned in the resume and how they match with the required tools and languages mentioned in the JD.

9. Soft Skills: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the soft skills mentioned in the resume and how they align with the required soft skills in the JD.

10. Location Alignment: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the location mentioned in the resume and how it aligns with the required location in the JD.

11. Cultural Fit: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the cultural fit mentioned in the resume and how it aligns with the cultural fit mentioned in the JD.

12. References and Recommendations: [Enter a value between 0 and 100] - We will assign a value based on the references and recommendations mentioned in the resume and how they align with the required references and recommendations in the JD.

Finally, we will calculate the overall matched percentage based on the weighted average of the above criteria.

Here is the matched percentage in JSON format:

{
  "Skills": 70,
  "Roles and Responsibilities": 85, 
  "Experience Matching": 80, 
  "Educational Qualifications": 40, 
  "Industry-Specific Experience": 0, 
  "Domain-Specific Experience": 60, 
  "Certifications": 0, 
  "Technical Tools and Languages": 70, 
  "Soft Skills": 50, 
  "Location Alignment": 100, 
  "Cultural Fit": 70, 
  "References and Recommendations": 0, 
  "Overall Percentage": 62.5
  }

The overall matched percentage is calculated by taking the weighted average of the above criteria:

Overall matched percentage = (80*0.1) + (85*0.1) + (70*0.1) + (75*0.1) + (80*0.1) + (70*0.1) + (65*0.1) + (85*0.1) + (90*0.1) + (100*0.1) + (70*0.1) + (60*0.1) = 77.5

Therefore, the overall matched percentage is 77.5%.

res1 = """
assistant_response:::: To calculate the matched percentage between the job description (JD) and the resume, we will assign a value between 0 and 100 for each criterion and then calculate the overall percentage.

Based on the given criteria, let's calculate the matched percentage:

1. Skills: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
Since the resume mentions skills like Nosql, Mysql, React, React.js, Python, Django, Typescript, Javascript, Aws, Redux, we can assign a value of 100 for this criterion.

2. Roles and Responsibilities: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]

3. Experience Matching: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
The resume mentions a total work experience of 3 years, with specific experience in REACT, PYTHON, and JavaScript. Since the job requires 3-4 years of work experience, we can assign a value of 75 for this criterion.

4. Educational Qualifications: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
The resume mentions SSC as the qualification. Since the job description does not specify any educational qualification, we can assign a value of 50 for this criterion.

5. Industry-Specific Experience: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
The resume does not mention any specific industry experience. Since the job description does not require any specific industry experience, we can assign a value of 50 for this criterion.

6. Domain-Specific Experience: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]

8. Technical Tools and Languages: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
The resume mentions skills like Jira, Regression testing, IOS, GIT, MS SQL Server, and Python, which are not specifically mentioned in the job description.

10. Location Alignment: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
Since the job description specifies the location as Coimbatore and mentions "Apply only if you can join in 2-4 weeks of time," if the candidate's location is Coimbatore and can join within the specified timeframe, we can assign a value of 100 for this criterion. Otherwise, we can assign a value of 0.

11. Cultural Fit: [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
Based on the information provided, we cannot determine the cultural fit. We can assign a value of 50 for this criterion.

13. Overall Percentage : [Enter a value between 0 and 100]
To calculate the overall percentage, we will take the average of the values assigned to each criterion:

Overall Percentage = (Skills + Roles and Responsibilities + Experience Matching + Educational Qualifications + Industry-Specific Experience + Domain-Specific Experience + Certifications + Technical Tools and Languages + Soft Skills + Location Alignment + Cultural Fit + References and Recommendations) / 12

Overall Percentage = (100 + 90 + 75 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 100 + 50 + 50) / 12
Overall Percentage = 784 / 12
Overall Percentage = 65.33

The overall percentage is approximately 65.33.
